// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names: string [] = ["Urwa","Zoriaz","Ahad"];

let message:string = `"would to like to learan some typesrtipt"`;

console.log(names [0] + " " + message);
console.log(names [1] + " " + message);
console.log(names [2] + " " + message);
